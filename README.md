# Data Visualization with Seaborn

Project from DataCamp in which the skills needed to visualize data sets with Seaborn based on multiple conditions are put to the test.

The main goal of this project is to ensure the ability to create visualizations with the Seaborn library in python. This is done through the manipulation of data and posterior selection of arguments according to the format provided in Seaborn. The evaluation of this skill takes place through the completion of a series of tasks presented in the jupyter notebook in this repository.

_The project tasks were developed by the platform DataCamp and they were completed by Brayan Orjuela_
